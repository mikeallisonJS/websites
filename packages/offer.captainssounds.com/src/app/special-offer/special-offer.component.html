        Hey, I'm Mike (aka Captain) and I've been DJing, promoting, and
        producing electronic music for over 20 years now. I used to be a
        hobbyist, working on music in what little spare time I had. I rarely
        finished any songs, my toolset was in constant flux, and I often didn't
        even get to a complete song idea. It wasn't until I was lucky enough to
        join the ranks of Ill Gate's Class of 808 that I realized one of the
        biggest things holding me back.
      </p>
      <p style="font-weight: bold">Having the right template.</p>
      <p>
        Working with chart topping artists from the Producer Dojo, along with
        all the coursework and instruction from the Class of 808 showed me just
        how important the right tools and workflow can be. Being able to sit
        down and just start writing without setup is crucial to finishing song
        ideas. Being able to take that idea and quickly mix it down is just as
        important.
      </p>
      <p>
        So, I'm sharing my secret sauce: My templates, the ones that have taken
        years of Ableton knowledge, thousands of dollars in education, and
        countless studio hours. This is what I see every day when I open Ableton
        (sans 3rd party sample libraries). This allows me to hit the ground
        running, then finish off with ease. I'm positive these templates can
        help maximize your production time, and help you hone in your perfect
        template as well. I'm so positive, I'll give you 100% back if you're not
        convinced.

      Here is what a few people had to say about the template when I first
      shared the template:
