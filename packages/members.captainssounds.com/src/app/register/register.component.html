  Your information is safe with us and will not be shared with any third party.
  We deliver via email to ensure you always have an easy way to access the
  download no matter where you are now, as well as have access to the racks
  later. We'll send an initial offer, but mostly we just send out notifications
  of free downloads & contests. Honestly, we hate spam as much as anybody, and
  we'd prefer to keep you around.
