A collection of over 120 of my favorite, personal household item foley sounds (jars, clinks, shakes, drops, scrapes and beeps) chopped onto a 128 rack then macro'd to provide optional glitched out repetitions. Additionally, I have added a bonus rack for using this as a foley layer for tops or as a top by itself. The entire foley recordings are included to mix/match or reimagine the hits. <br><br>(The mod wheel mapping on this adjusts sample offset for additional glitching)
