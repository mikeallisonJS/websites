<p>This is where it all began, the first of my racks. I no longer personally use it, as I prefer to volume envelope my sidechains now for a more precise cut. If you're looking for a more complete approach, I highly recommend the sidechain templates, as they do a much better job than the aging 'sidechain your drums' approach.</p>
<p>This Ableton rack is great for sidechaining both a kick and a snare (I highly recommend a short click or midi trigger). This is fantastic for any sidechain with a short attack that you don't want to click.</p>
<p>It also includes the requisite Live 8 compressor (don't upgrade if you want clickless).</p>
<p>To use: expand the compressors and select your side chain input channels (see pic 2)</p>
<p>Shout out to Mitch Brady for the tip on the Live 8 compressor!</p>
